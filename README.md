Project: Recipes
this is the weekly Project on git basics and itroduction on HTML
by the end of this project, I will be able to build my own project on github by creating repositories, cloning it to the virtual machineand making any change I want to it and adding new tasks on it

pulling, pushing, commiting, adding new task done in command line
making directories, creating files, checking process of my task by using git status and git log commands is also what I learnt in this project
configuration of my github and my viltual machine is another skill I gain from this project
